                                            RESEARCH ON RIGHT SHIFT OPERATOR

The right shift (>>) operator in Python moves the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of places. 
This effectively divides the number by 2ⁿ (where n is the shift amount), discarding the shifted-out bits.

SYNTAX:
result = a >> n

where,
a = Number to shift
n = Number of positions to shift right
result = a divided by 2ⁿ (integer division)

EXAMPLE:
x = 32  # Binary: 100000
y = x >> 3  # Shift right by 3 places
print(y)  

Output: 4 (Binary: 100)
